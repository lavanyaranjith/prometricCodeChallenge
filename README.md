You are developing an application using C# and Visual Studio that will be used by students all over the world.

Create a Console application with classes that will properly represent the following constructs.



Requirements
1. Define a Shape object, where the object is any two-dimensional figure, and has the following characteristics: a name, perimeter and

a surface area.



2. Define a Circle object which retains the aforementioned characteristics of a Shape. The calculations for a circle are:

- Area of circle = Pi*R*R  where R=Radius ,Pi=3.14

- Perimeter (circumference) of circle = 2*Pi*R where R=Radius ,Pi=3.14



3. Define a Triangle object which retains the aforementioned characteristics of a Shape. The name of the triangle should take into

account if it is equilateral (all 3 sides are the same length), isosceles (only 2 sides are the same length) or scalene (no 2 sides are

the same).

- Area of triangle = (Height * base) / 2

- Perimeter of triangle = a + b +c



4. Define 2 different quadrilaterals, a Square and Rectangle which retains the aforementioned characteristics of a Shape.

  The name should take into account if all sides are the same length.

  - Area of Square/Rectangle = width*length

  - Perimeter of Square/Rectangle = (width + length) * 2



5. We want to be able to sort a collection of Shapes by Area or Perimeter.

  Define methods/classes/interfaces that support this scenario and provide an example in Main.

  

6. We want to be able serialize/store shapes in various formats on disk.

  Define methods/classes/etc that support this scenario and provide an example in Main (xml/json/binary/etc pick one)

  

7. We want to be able track(in memory) the number of Shape objects created (per class)

  Define methods/classes/etc that support this scenario and provide an example in Main



-Main should initialize all classes and output all characteristics as per above.

 All characteristics when called should be output to the console.

-Text output format is up to you.

-You can add/remove classes as you see fit 

-You can add/remove/move(between classes) characteristics as you see fit
